# Coding Challenge 5

This challenge forcused on heatmaps.

I used two species datasets- pinnipeds and sea turtles, which were both located in the Azorean Islands.
I ended up joining the two datasets and creating only one heatmap. I later learned I was supposed to create two heatmaps, but honestly, taking the extra setp to join the datasets challenged me and taught me a lot, so it was a bit of a happy accident!
