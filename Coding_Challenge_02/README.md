# Coding Challenge 2

In this challenge, I worked with lists, strings, dictionaries, and user input. 

## Part 1. List values-
making a new list, printing, and learning how to make lists in only one line

## Part 2. List overlap
Determining which items overlap and do not overlap in lists. 

## 3. Strings
Given a singe phrase, count the occurrence of each word and print

## 4. User input
Ask the user for an input of their current age, and tell them how many years until they reach retirement (65 years old).

## 5. User input 2
Using a dictionary, ask the user for a word, and compute the Scrabble word score for that word
