## Introduction
My name is Isabella, but most people call me Bella. I am from Gloucester, Massachusetts and I am a senior at URI. I am double majoring in Environmental Science and Italian, with a Chemistry minor. After I graduate, I hope to get a job in either environmental chemistry/lab work or GIS, and eventually go to grad school. 

## Fast fun facts
* I speak 3 languages, one of which is endangered.
* I have a little brother, Peter. He is 18 and studying Motorsports Engineering at Oxford Brookes University in England.
* My hometown, Gloucester, is an island, so I have lived by the water my whole life.
* I have hiked one of the most active volcanoes in the world (Mt. Etna).
* I am a URI Tour Guide, so I know a LOT about this school.

## Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include:
* Dancing üíÉ
  - I have been dancing since I was 2, and my favorite style is tap!
* Sewing/embroidery/knitting ü™°
  - I love making and personalizing my own clothes!
* Cooking üçù
  -My favorite thing to cook is pasta, my roommates say I make a killer carbonara.
* Gardening üå± 
  - I have a vegetable garden and a pollinator garden at home!ü¶ã:bee:

You may be wondering, _Italian major? That seems pretty random._
You would be correct, it is pretty random. Actually- fun fact- Italian was my first language. My parents are from Italy and I am an Italian citizen. I chose to double major in Italian because I learned the language orally and wanted to get a formal education to learn the grammar/rules. 
A lot of my family lives in Sicily, so I visit a lot. I also studied abroad there last year!
In addition to speaking Italian, I also speak Sicilian, which is an endangered language!

### I am very excited for this course and hope it can help me a lot in the future!
