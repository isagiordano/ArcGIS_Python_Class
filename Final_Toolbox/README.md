# Final Toolbox

This toolbox (Bella's Final Toolbox) contains 4 tools- Select, Clip, Buffer, and AddMessage tools.
They are all part of one workflow (save for the last tool) in which lakes in Washington County are buffered 200 ft as per RI state guidelines for large waterbodies. 
The AddMessage tool asks a very simple yes or no question and takes one input as a string. 

The data folder provided contains a Lakes of Rhode Island shapefile and a Towns of Rhode Island shapefile. The data folder is also the output location for the shapefiles generated by the toolbox. 
The two shapefiles are all that is needed to run this toolbox, as it builds on itself and will use other generated files as the inputs.
