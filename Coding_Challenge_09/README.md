# Coding Challenge 9

This challenge used arcpy.da to do some basic dataset partitioning. 

From the Forest Health Works dataset, I extracted sites that had a photo of the invasive species, counted which records had photos or did not have photos, count the unique species, and create 2 shapefiles for the records with and without photos.
