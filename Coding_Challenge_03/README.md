# Coding Challenge 3

For this challenge, I worked with directories, sys.argv, and csv files.

## 1. Simple directory tree
Replicating a directory tree with os.system or os.mkdirs, and then deleting the directory without deleting my entire hard drive.

## 2. Push sys.argv to the limit
Creating a python script that takes a minimum of 3 imputs from a bat file and does something to them, and prints it.

## 3. Working with CSV
Using the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii dataset
Calculating Annual average for each year in the dataset, Minimum, maximum and average for the entire dataset, Seasonal average for each season, and
Calculate the anomaly for each value in the dataset relative to the mean for the entire time series.
