# Midterm Coding Challenge

For this challenge, I needed to provide a dataset and create a script that ran the dataset over 3 different processes. 
The tool needs to manipulate a dataset across three different processes, for example, extracting, modifying and exporting data. The exact workflow is entirely up to yourself. You are expected to take 3-4 hours on this coding assignment, and you should deposit your code and example files within a Github repository for feedback and grading.
